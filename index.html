        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-cyan-400">Patient Monitoring Module</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mt-2">A comprehensive patient monitoring system designed to track body posture, respiratory activity, and environmental conditions in real time. This project integrates multiple sensors to collect physiological and ambient data, enabling continuous, non-intrusive monitoring for patients in clinical or home care settings. The module uses embedded systems to process and analyze data locally, with capabilities for wireless communication to healthcare platforms for remote observation. The goal of this project is to support early detection of health anomalies, improve patient comfort, and enhance the quality of care through intelligent, connected monitoring.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-cyan-400">Object Picking and Placing with 6-DoF Manipulator</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mt-2">This project focuses on developing an automated object picking and placing system using a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF) robotic manipulator powered by Dynamixel actuators. The system leverages inverse kinematics to accurately calculate joint angles for precise end-effector positioning. Matlab was used extensively for simulation, kinematic modeling, and control algorithm development. The manipulator was programmed to detect object positions and execute smooth, coordinated movements for reliable grasping and placement. This project highlights advanced robotic control techniques and demonstrates the integration of hardware and algorithmic logic in real-world automation tasks.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-cyan-400">ROS-based LiDAR mapping and camera-driven people tracking for autonomous robots</h3>
        <p class="text-sm mt-2">The project of a robot intended for autonomous mapping and environmental exploration is described in the paper. Whether the robot navigates automatically or manually, it is always beneficial to create maps of the area. The robot uses sensors to sense its environment; sophisticated sensors like LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) are especially important because they offer information for creating intricate maps. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the methods used in the creation of environment maps. Together with sophisticated motion planning and obstacle avoidance strategies, the produced maps are utilized for real-time robot navigation, which guarantees effective and secure environment exploration. Determining the distribution of persons in rooms was the goal. The project created rooms, detection items (people), the robot itself, and its sensors using the Gazebo simulation environment. The ROS localization package's SLAM technique was used to map the environment using information from the wheel odometry and IMU sensor. The SORT tracking module and the YOLOv5 object recognition technique were used to track things in camera photos. The robot and object had a 99% success rate at the closest distance and a 74% success rate at the furthest distance in the object detection tests. Additionally, tests in which the robot and objects remained immobile had the best tracking accuracy.</p>
